# node-js-app-CICD

This repository is created to set up a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline (either CICD pipeline or freestyle project pipeline).
The first step in the process is to create a pull request.

The repository also contains environment files and a few additional files (such as code files or APKs) required during setup.
The main purpose of this repository is that â€” when you clone or copy it, the environment gets automatically installed and configured.
